                <h3>What is Git?</h3>
                <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a  whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</p>
                <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add</p>
